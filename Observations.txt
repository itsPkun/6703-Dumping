Some observations

1. While BA is LOW, the PLA only allows writes to the internal RAM (for IRQ/JSR presumedly). This means that any Read-Modify-Write instruction performed on anything using the PLA R/W signal (VIC, Colour RAM, and external RAM) runs the risk of not being able to do the second (correct) write if BA asserts during its execution. This doesn't appear to cause problems with single cycle writes.

2. While clock is LOW, A14 and A15 effectively do nothing. You have a 16k Address bus at this point. Any external add-on should force A14-A15 for itself by checking the phase of the clock signal.

3. No Mirrors in unused address space. It's yours for the taking. Want a 32k MAX BASIC? You should be able to do it (caveats above and below).

4. BA (and CLOCK, naturally) causes the upper 4k of ROMH to be banked in. This will be a probem if you want to use RMW instructions at 3000-3FFF, 7000-7FFF, or B000-BFFF.

5. While BA is LOW it doesn't appear possible to write to the SID as chip_select doesn't get asserted.

More to come?
